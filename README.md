# Insights & Reporting
## Dataset
The dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` is too large to include in this repository. You can download it from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data).
## Key Insights
1. **Vaccination Progress**: Among the selected countries (Brazil, Germany, China), Germany shows the fastest vaccination rollout, with a higher percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
2. **Case Trends**: Brazil experienced the highest number of daily new cases during the peak of the pandemic, while China maintained relatively low daily case counts.
3. **Death Rate Analysis**: The death rate (total deaths/total cases) has been declining over time for all countries, indicating improved treatment or containment measures.
4. **Correlation Patterns**: A strong positive correlation exists between total cases and total deaths, as shown in the heatmap, while vaccination metrics show a weaker correlation with new cases.
5. **Global Overview**: The choropleth map highlights countries with the highest total cases, with the United States and India leading globally.

## Anomalies and Patterns
- **China's Data**: Despite being one of the first countries affected, China's total cases and deaths remain significantly lower than other countries, which could indicate effective containment or reporting differences.
- **Vaccination Disparities**: The percentage of the population vaccinated varies widely, with some countries achieving near-complete coverage while others lag behind.
- **Death Rate Fluctuations**: Some countries show temporary spikes in death rates, possibly due to overwhelmed healthcare systems during case surges.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations support these insights:
- Line plots for total cases, total deaths, and vaccination progress over time.
- A bar chart comparing cumulative cases across countries.
- A heatmap showing correlations between key COVID-19 metrics.
- A choropleth map for global case distribution.
